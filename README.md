Myself and some other friends have recently been noticing some very "peak and valley" behavior on our Verizon FiOS lines in the Northern Virginia area.  There are certain peak times when traffic is noticeably slower (9pm EST on a Tuesday night when, nation-wide, practically everyone is either watching TV or streaming video of some sort).

I wanted to see if I could track this.

There's a wonderful Python CLI utility called Speedtest-CLI by Matt Martz (https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) that I'm using to run queries to the closest local server.

In the end I want this to be extremely configurable, run daemonized, and present the user with a web-interface where they can track graphs, get basic statistics, and reconfigure the application.  Some SPA type thing built in Angular or...well...who knows.  It's 2AM and I'm tired.  This isn't how normal people spend Friday evenings.
